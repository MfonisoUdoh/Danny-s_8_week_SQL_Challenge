# Danny-s_8_week_SQL_Challenge
In this Danny's 8 weeks SQL challenge, I have tackled a series of real-world SQL problems, each representing a different scenario encountered in a typical business environment. By working through these challenges, I have honed my SQL skills, gaining hands-on experience in data analysis, query optimiSation, and database manipulation.
